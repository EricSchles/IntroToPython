#Welcome to Python

Our first python program/ Why you should learn python:

`import antigravity`

As this awesome comic shows - python is easy to learn, easy to use, and makes programming a breeze.

Tonight I'll show you how to make programs that do a number of great things:

1) Save the world
2) Build a website
3) Write an android application
4) 'Make' a friend
5) Make a game
6) Recognize a friend

Now that I've made a number of claims, let's discuss the philosophy of python

`import this`

Analysis of this text:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
--You should always write code that looks good.  
--The antithesis of this would be a language like brainfuck or (some) perl code.

Explicit is better than implicit.
--Your code should explain itself.  Code that is explicit is well written, and it's intention is clear.  This is accomplished by good naming of variables, by good naming of functions, by good naming of classes.  When you are writing code, you are inventing your own language of computation.  Making sure that this language will make sense to others is the goal here.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.
--The real statement here is - always make your programs as simple as possible, but never simplier.
--If you can do something easily, do it that way.  For instance, let's say someone asks you to write a function that does addition - you have a number of ways you could do this:
Using the standard rule for addition
Writing a machine learning algorithm that takes in a number of cases of addition and tries to come up with what it thinks is a reasonable addition operator
Writing your own adder function from scratch with binary operations.
Or some other nuts thing.
The simple answer is simply wrap the addition operator and then add in any extra functionality you need.  


Flat is better than nested.
--The natural analogy here is to file systems (for those of you coming from a non-programming background).  It's always better to have folders with one set of files in them rather than a million subfolders with one file each.  

Sparse is better than dense.
--For those of you coming from other languages the idea is - Don't hide anymore functionality than you have to AND above all, don't have functions that do lots and lots of things.


Readability counts.
--Make sure even lay people can read your code, even if they don't fully understand it.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
--Don't be cute.  Do things in a pure when you can, but know when not to.

Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
--Handle your errors intelligently.  When your program failes, make sure you know why it fails.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
--Actually do your homework, don't just say things.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
--OOP is probably something you should do.
